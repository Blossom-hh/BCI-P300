# P300 Brain Computer Interface (BCI)
Brain Computer Interface project in which I use wide and deep convolutional neural networks to decode P300 component in EEG signals for a speller application. I also use saliency maps for visualizing the features learned by the model. These maps are then quantified to reveal the task-related brain dynamics.
